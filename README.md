# virtualname-whmcs

This repository exists to keep the Virtualname WHMCS module under a version control system, as the original one is provided with no changelog (or, at least, not as frequently updated as it should).

All credits, licensing issues, and copyright to their original owners.

You can download the original WHMCS virtulname module from their [download page](https://whmcs.virtualname.net/descargas/).

Note that this README.md file is not part of the original module.
